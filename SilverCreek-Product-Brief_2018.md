### <span style="color:rgb(107,194,140)">Executive Overview</span>
Whether your job is to find SNMP compliance problems or to fix them, the SilverCreek SNMP test suite is your most valuable ally. SilverCreek is a
software product for design, quality assurance, and test engineers to find and fix bugs in their SNMP agent implementations. The SilverCreek SNMP
software is so easy to use that anyone who can navigate a graphical user interface can quickly run a battery of individual, comprehensive tests.

The tests are designed to detect and diagnose implementation errors in private and standard MIBs as well as SNMPv1, v2c, and v3 stacks and
implementations. Yet SilverCreek is so powerful, extensible, and flexible, power users can create the ideal solution for virtually any testing environment.

SilverCreek is the Authoritative SNMP Test Suite -- designed to test implementations of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP agents)
and standard and private MIBs (Management Information Bases). SilverCreek incorporates thousands of small, single function tests written in the Tcl
scripting language to exercise one or a small number of parameters. The syntactic tests verify protocol compliance, error and exception handling,
and boundary condition behavior. The functionality tests (semantic tests) verify performance, trap/alert/event/notification handling, counter accuracy,
security, and many other implementation specific areas.

SilverCreek's SNMP engine is written in C++. The testing interface is written in the interpretive Tcl/Tk scripting language. Users may modify or extend
test scripts without programming. Using the SilverCreek management information base (MIB) browser is just as easy. Clicking on any leaf automatically
launches the SNMP Command Tool, which allows users to view the contents of the agentâ€™s object identifier (OID) tree and issue GETs and SETs.
Because the MIB browser combines SNMP GET and NEXT requests on modified object identifiers, it discovers MIB branches in a manner that is
more efficient, more thorough, and more accurate than the average MIB walk. Combined with the MIB Lookup Tool and support for private MIBs, the SilverCreek MIB Browser boosts productivity to new levels.

The SilverCreek SNMP Test Suite was developed and refined by InterWorking Labs, Inc. with the help of the Advisory Board comprised of key SNMP
technology experts from the IETF. Attending the IETF meetings, commenting on drafts in progress, and evaluating interoperability issues with other
participants assures the best understanding of the standards documents which translates into meaningful tests. This results in the most accurate,
credible, and comprehensive test suites possible.

### <span style="color:rgb(107,194,140)">A Rich Toolset</span>
For probing, sniffing, and inspecting individual objects, components or subsystems of your product's SNMP implementation, the toolset includes:
#### MIB Tools 
* A MIB browser that actively probes the agent for the true value of objects
* A MIB compiler that allows you to add, compile, and automatically test your private MIB, or any IETF MIB
    * Add and compile any MIB (private or standard)
    * Automatically compile and load multiple MIBs (all at once)
    * Add and compile an agent-capabilitiy MIB
    * Select one or more branches of MIBs for testing
* A MIB Lookup Tool for quick and convenient access to information about a MIB object. Provides basic
* information such as descriptor name, OID, syntax, access, status, and index.
* A MIB Scope Tool to isolate a portion of the agent's objects to focus testing on a specific set of
* objects
* MIB Compare Tool
* MIB Walker
* MIB Table Inspector
* MIB Dictionary
* Validate MIBs by 6 Severity Levels
#### Traps, Alerts, Informs
* A Trap Monitor to visually examine the contents of all traps
* A Trap Tester that works with the Trap Monitor to verify syntax, ordering, and correct indexing of the incoming event.
#### Utilities
* A Command Line Interface that allows command line SNMP requests outside of the
* SilverCreek application
* A Command Tool for issuing SNMP SET, GET, and GET-NEXT commands
* An ODBC (Open Data Base Connection) tool, a powerful way to process test results
* and generate reports.
* A Command Script Wizard to build complicated SNMP commands, generate and
* store requests as scripts and reload them.
* Polling Tool
* Memory Leak Tool
* Performance Measuring Tool
#### Diagnostic Tools
* A Packet Monitor that demonstrates the flow of traffic to an and from the agent under test in three output types: octet, pseudo-ASN.1, and/or
